# Live proposals

Home for proposals awaiting execution (first occupant: the doc-search
proposal, archived 2026-08-23). House rule (2026-08-21): file a proposal
here BEFORE implementing multi-slice work. Acceptance criteria for any
change that alters query-visible semantics (rosters, crosswalks,
hierarchies, extractor rules) MUST carry an eval-gate bullet —
`helpers/misc/ontology_eval_gate.py` over the frozen question set
between dry-run and canonical apply (ontology_governance S2). On Status
EXECUTED, move it to
`../archive/<topic>/` and add the `../completed.md` entry in the same
change — and update any `embed_eval_questions.json` labels referencing
the old path (see `doc/procedures/doc-search.md` §Corpus lifecycle).

Full archival checklist (extended 2026-08-26 after finding a duplicate
entry number and stale DONE pointers):

1. `git mv` to `../archive/<topic>/`; repoint any `**Follows**:` /
   cross-references at the old `proposals/` path.
2. `../completed.md`: entry exists and number is UNIQUE (audit
   `rg '^## \d+\.'` for duplicates — parallel sessions can mint the same
   number; suffix the un-referenced one, e.g. `105b`, never renumber).
3. `../pending.md`: grep the topic; close/annotate deferred items the
   work completes.
4. `../archive/README.md`: add the topic-index line with the completed.md
   number; reset the live-proposal pointer below to `_(none)_`.
5. `make search-fresh APPLY=1`, then plain `make search-fresh` (rc=0)
   to converge the doc index.
6. Flip the frontmatter block in the same change: `status: executed`
   + the executed date + the completed.md number — the Proposal
   lifecycle static check fails an archived proposal still saying
   `proposed` (corpus_uniformity S3).

## Current live proposals

_(Pending patches: review_kit.md is filed and rides its own unapplied
patch — its index line lands here as that patch applies.)_ Per-patch
rule (2026-09-19): a proposal's index line is added by the SAME patch
that adds its file, so this section never references content from
future patches.

_(Previously: mojo_footprint_repair.md executed 2026-09-19 as
completed.md entry 247 (archived to `../archive/tooling/`);
industry_coding_completion.md executed 2026-09-19 as entry 248
(archived to `../archive/database/`); nic2008_seed_table.md executed
2026-09-19 as entry 246 (archived to `../archive/database/`);
tmpdir_sanitization.md archived 2026-09-17 as entry 245.)_
